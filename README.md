artisanally hand-coded, going for a slight early internet, simpler vibe but with a clean visual style

also took influence (stole ideas from) [louie zong's website](https://louiezong.com).

the phrase 'internet website' and its placement was gleefully stolen from [clowncore's beautiful website](https://clowncore.computer).
